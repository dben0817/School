<h3>Here is a Sample of the projects I worked on in school.</h3>

Included are a few of the simple apps we created in Android Development classes, as well as the .java files from a few of my Java classes. I only included the
.java files to save on size as these will likely be used for a quick reference on my ability to write code and the way that I space, style, and comment.
